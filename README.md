# -Web-Application-for-Analyzing-NYC-Collision-Data-


Our team built a cutting-edge web application on NYC Collision Analysis, leveraging Python, Streamlit, PyDeck, Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery, SQL, and Looker Studio. Using advanced data analysis techniques, we extracted and processed extensive collision data from NYC Open Data, storing it in GCP BigQuery. We then used Looker Studio to create interactive visualizations that showcased the insights we gained from our analysis.

But that's not all - we wanted to take our project to the next level by making it accessible and useful for everyone. So we built a sleek and user-friendly web application using Streamlit, enabling anyone to easily access and explore the collision data and our findings. Users can filter and sort data by various parameters, such as location, time, and type of collision, and view the data on a map, thanks to PyDeck.

Our application has the potential to make a significant impact on public safety, by providing valuable insights and identifying trends that can inform policy and decision-making. We're excited about the possibilities of this project and its potential to make our roads safer for everyone.
